RandomForest is a realistic algorithm for regression and classification that lays fundamentals for learning about gradient boosting. I was very excited to be learning about this algorithm theoretically and later using pandas, scikit-learn and shape to prepare the dataset and make a somewhat explained prediction. 

This particular dataset contains information about bike rent numbers in South Korea with factors like rainfall, snowfall and temperature.
